 abstract = {The most effective use of discriminant functions presumes an expedient selection of character for measurement. Such characters should possess (a) individually, a high coefficient of discrimination, K, relating interspecific and intraspecific variability, and (b) taken in pairs, a high intraspecific correlation, with the interspecific correlation of opposite sign. A considerable increase of discrimination can be attained graphically following V. I. Romanovsky. The consideration of scatter-diagrams and correlation-ellipses suggests a new criterion, the rank of discrimination, R, whose relation to K is R = $\sqr{K/2}$. For any two out of three species of Chaetocnema, a pair of discriminant functions, each based on three characters, provides excellent discrimination: discrimination between the species used to construct the functions and the third species is less satisfactory. Corresponding coefficients in the three pairs of functions differ appreciably, but when correlation ellipses for the three pairs are plotted, the relative positions of the ellipses for the three species are the same. New pairs of functions, whose coefficients are arithmetic or (Figure 9) geometric means of the coefficients in the separate pairs permit a clean separation of all three species in one figure. The results obtained indicate the possibility of measuring taxonomic likeness, and of developing objective criteria for the construction of a natural system of organisms.},

abstract = {This richly illustrated book describes the use of interactive and dynamic graphics
as part of multidimensional data analysis. Chapters include clustering, supervised
classification, and working with missing values. A variety of plots and interaction
methods are used in each analysis, often starting with brushing linked low-dimensional
views and working up to manual manipulation of tours of several variables. The role
of graphical methods is shown at each step of the analysis, not only in the early
exploratory phase, but in the later stages, too, when comparing and evaluating models.
All examples are based on freely available software: GGobi for interactive graphics
and R for static graphics, modeling, and programming. The printed book is augmented
by a wealth of material on the web, encouraging readers follow the examples themselves.
The web site has all the data and code necessary to reproduce the analyses in the
book, along with movies demonstrating the examples. The book may be used as a text
in a class on statistical graphics or exploratory data analysis, for example, or as
a guide for the independent learner. Each chapter ends with a set of exercises. The
authors are both Fellows of the American Statistical Association, past chairs of the
Section on Statistical Graphics, and co-authors of the GGobi software. Dianne Cook
is Professor of Statistics at Iowa State University. Deborah Swayne is a member of
the Statistics Research Department at AT&T Labs. }

   abstract = {A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

    abstract = {Background Sexual segregation in vertebrate foraging niche is often associated with sexual size dimorphism (SSD), i.e., ecological sexual dimorphism. Although foraging behavior of male and female seabirds can vary markedly, differences in isotopic (carbon, δ13C and nitrogen, δ15N) foraging niche are generally more pronounced within sexually dimorphic species and during phases when competition for food is greater. We examined ecological sexual dimorphism among sympatric nesting Pygoscelis penguins asking whether environmental variability is associated with differences in male and female pre-breeding foraging niche. We predicted that all Pygoscelis species would forage sex-specifically, and that higher quality winter habitat, i.e., higher or lower sea ice coverage for a given species, would be associated with a more similar foraging niche among the sexes.  Results P2/P8 primers reliably amplified DNA of all species. On average, male Pygoscelis penguins are structurally larger than female conspecifics. However, chinstrap penguins were more sexually dimorphic in culmen and flipper features than Adélie and gentoo penguins. Adélies and gentoos were more sexually dimorphic in body mass than chinstraps. Only male and female chinstraps and gentoos occupied separate δ15N foraging niches. Strong year effects in δ15N signatures were documented for all three species, however, only for Adélies, did yearly variation in δ15N signatures tightly correlate with winter sea ice conditions. There was no evidence that variation in sex-specific foraging niche interacted with yearly winter habitat quality.  Conclusion Chinstraps were most sexually size dimorphic followed by gentoos and Adélies. Pre-breeding sex-specific foraging niche was associated with overall SSD indices across species; male chinstrap and gentoo penguins were enriched in δ15N relative to females. Our results highlight previously unknown trophic pathways that link Pygoscelis penguins with variation in Southern Ocean sea ice suggesting that each sex within a species should respond similarly in pre-breeding trophic foraging to changes in future winter habitat.},

As designers of charts we have to make sure that information is shown with a minimum of distortion. We have to also consider illusions and other perceptual limitations of our audience. In this paper we discuss the effect and strength of the line width illusion, a Muller-Lyer type illusion, on designs related to displaying associations between categorical variables. Parallel sets and hammock plots are both affected by line width illusions. We introduce the common-angle plot as an alternative method for displaying categorical data in a manner that minimizes the effect from perceptual illusions. Results from user studies both highlight the need for addressing line-width illusions in displays and provide evidence that common angle charts successfully resolve this issue.},

@article{tidyr,
   abstract = {A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},
